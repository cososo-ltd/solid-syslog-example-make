# solid-syslog-example

A worked integration of [SolidSyslog](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog), built up in
stages — from a device with no syslog at all to one whose records are authenticated and encrypted.

Each stage is one commit. It says what it does, what it changes, what it gives you, and what it
costs. The costs are measured by the device itself, not estimated.

It builds on a baseline that simulates the sort of device you might be adding this to, and that
measures itself: see [docs/baseline.md](docs/baseline.md) for what the baseline is, how the
figures are made, and how to run it.

## This stage — Header fields

The record so far carries no timestamp and no device name. Fill the RFC 5424 header fields from
what the device already has: the clock it acquired at boot, the address on its interface, and its
own name.

```c
struct SolidSyslogConfig config = {
    /* ... */
    .Clock       = SyslogFields_Clock,
    .GetHostname = SyslogFields_Hostname,
    .GetAppName  = SyslogFields_AppName,
};
```

```text
<134>1 2026-09-28T11:10:09.570000Z 10.0.2.15 solid-syslog-example - BOOT - device started
```

PROCID stays nil, because a bare-metal image has no process to identify, and so does
STRUCTURED-DATA until the next stage.

Two things the adapters have to get right. The timestamp struct is zeroed before it is filled, so a
clock that cannot answer leaves `Month == 0`, fails the library's validation, and is emitted as the
nil value rather than as a wrong time. And the hostname is read under the lwIP core lock, with
`ip4addr_ntoa_r` rather than `ip4addr_ntoa` — the latter shares one static buffer across callers.

Where a device has no resolvable name, RFC 5424 section 6.2.4 allows its address in the HOSTNAME
field instead, which is this device exactly.

**When you need it.** As soon as more than one device reports to the collector, or a record's time
will be relied on. Everything the later stages add — a sequence number, the clock's quality, the
device's own identity — builds on these fields rather than replacing them.

This example's own code is [0BSD](LICENSE) — completely open, no conditions.

Third-party code keeps its own license: the vendored Arm SMSC9220 driver (`app/net/smsc9220/`) is
Apache-2.0 (see its `LICENSE`). FreeRTOS, lwIP, mbedTLS and FatFs are under `third_party/` and used
under their own upstream licenses — [`third_party/README.md`](third_party/README.md) says which,
and how each is pinned or vendored.

SolidSyslog is fetched at build time and is likewise not redistributed here. It is offered under
three alternative licenses, which its own
[LICENSE.md](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog/blob/main/LICENSE.md) sets out.
