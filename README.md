# solid-syslog-example

A worked integration of [SolidSyslog](https://github.com/cososo-ltd/solid-syslog), built up in
stages — from a device with no syslog at all to one whose records are authenticated and encrypted.

Each stage is one commit. It says what it does, what it changes, what it gives you, and what it
costs. The costs are measured by the device itself, not estimated.

It builds on a baseline that simulates the sort of device you might be adding this to, and that
measures itself: see [docs/baseline.md](docs/baseline.md) for what the baseline is, how the
figures are made, and how to run it.

## This stage — Logger created

Create the logger with both collaborators absent, deliberately, and read what the handler prints.

```c
struct SolidSyslogConfig config = {
    .Buffer = NULL,
    .Sender = NULL,
};

struct SolidSyslog* logger = SolidSyslog_Create(&config);
```

No `_Create` fails or returns `NULL` — a missing collaborator is substituted with its Null object
and reported — so the only evidence is what the handler says:

```text
[syslog] CRITICAL SolidSyslog bad-config (detail 1)
[syslog] CRITICAL SolidSyslog bad-config (detail 2)
[syslog] CRITICAL SolidSyslog bad-config (detail 3)
```

Three, for the buffer, the sender and the store. Each names the collaborator in `Detail`, as a
value of the emitting class's own error enum.

The order matters. Wire everything at once and see nothing, and you cannot tell a working logger
from a silent one. Seeing the faults first, then watching them go quiet as each collaborator
arrives, is the difference between believing it works and knowing.

A convention worth adopting now: `NULL` as a parameter means "not supplied" and is reported, while
a collaborator you have deliberately done without is passed as its Null object. The library
distinguishes the two, and so should anyone reading the wiring later.

**When you need it.** As a step rather than a destination. It costs one build to prove the handler
is connected and the library is reachable, before anything can be blamed on the network.

under their own upstream licenses — [`third_party/README.md`](third_party/README.md) says which,

SolidSyslog is fetched at build time and is likewise not redistributed here. It is offered under
three alternative licenses, which its own
